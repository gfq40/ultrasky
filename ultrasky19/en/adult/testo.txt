"A Journey Through Time and Space â€“ Composition 2"
This second glass-fusing artwork by Giuliano Giuman embodies an intense fusion of symbols and materials. The piece engages in an open dialogue with millennia of history through the precise use of Egyptian blue, whose traces and fragments are skillfully blended with sand from the Sinai, evoking images of ancient paths and distant memories.

The solid fragments enclosed within the transparent glass tell hidden stories, offering a narrative that evolves over time and shifts with the ambient light, in a continuous process of perceptual transformation.
