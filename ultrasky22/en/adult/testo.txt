"A Kilo of Clay in My Hands", by Erica Tamborini, is an installation of clay vessels shaped using the oldest and most basic technique. There is evidence that tournettes—the earliest forms of potter’s wheel, developed as an extension of the original hand-forming process—were already in use around 4500 BCE in the Near East, eventually evolving into the fast wheel invented in the third millennium BCE.

Each vessel in this installation is shaped by a gesture, both full and empty—an emanation of the hands that molded and held it, almost as if the hands themselves became the vessel. The rhythm of time is marked by the shaping gesture of each artifact, accompanied by the presence of blue pigment. Since ancient Egyptian times, this blue has evoked the sky and the light, recalling Vincent Van Gogh’s words: “I never get tired of the blue sky.” In the repetition of the formal exercise, the gesture layers upon itself, leaving an invisible imprint on the surfaces—a silent echo of the hand that shapes and transforms. Each vessel becomes a fragment of solidified time, where the flow of time settles into the material.

This installation engages in a dialogue with the archaeological museum like a bridge between distant eras, bringing the ancient into the contemporary, the primordial gesture into today’s sensibility. The vessels, in their collective presence, are not merely objects—they are witnesses of a memory in the making.
