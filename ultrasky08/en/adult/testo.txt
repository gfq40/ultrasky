"Eye" by Andrea Chidichimo is a work that offers an intriguing perceptual short circuit between non-iconic abstraction and subjectless figuration. At the center of the composition emerges an eye—a powerful visual symbol—which becomes a refined homage to the great Renaissance tradition of Raphael. The artist directly references the celebrated fresco The Triumph of Galatea, in which recent studies by the Accademia dei Lincei have revealed the presence of Egyptian blue in the sclera of the eye, evoking the pictorial techniques of classical Greek statuary.

Andrea Chidichimo uses Egyptian blue—detectable only through visible-induced luminescence (VIL) analysis—on strategic points of the sclera and in the bright reflection cast upon the iris. In doing so, the ancient pigment does not assert itself visually with its usual chromatic intensity but remains concealed, becoming a poetic metaphor for a deep connection with the artistic past and, at the same time, a symbol of ongoing experimental exploration toward uncharted horizons. Through this technical and conceptual choice, Chidichimo invites us to reflect on the expressive possibilities of contemporary art, silently engaging in dialogue with the great masters of art history.
