"Inganno" by Franco Vitelli is a work of art that plays with our eyes and makes us think about what we see. It is made of many geometric shapes, similar to infinity symbols, enhanced by a special color called Egyptian blue. When you look at the sculpture, it seems like you are seeing a beautiful design of colors and shapes. But if you use a special viewer called VIL, the colors disappear and only the geometric lines remain, like a magic trick!

This change makes you realize that what we see isn’t everything—there's always something more to discover. The work becomes a fun mystery that brings together the old and the new, inviting us to imagine and question what we perceive.
