"Blue Geometries Sweater" by Viola Alpi is a special example of how art and design can work together. On this sweater, geometric shapes in Egyptian blue stand out on the surface, creating visual effects that look like a fun play of lights and colors. It's not just a piece of clothingâ€”it becomes a wearable work of art. Wearing it means showing off your style and being part of a world where art makes every day more special.
