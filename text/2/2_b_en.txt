The "Ultrasky Scarf" by Viola Alpi is a very special piece of clothing that brings art and fashion together in a surprising way. Using "Egyptian blue," a deep and intense color, the artist created a scarf that seems to have a life of its own. The soft fabric catches the light and shows many different shades of blue, just like a magical sky.

When you wear this scarf, it's like wrapping yourself in an enchanted sky, where colors and light tell mysterious and fascinating stories. With this work, Viola Alpi invites us to discover the power of colors and to be amazed by the beauty all around us.
