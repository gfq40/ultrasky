"Kimono d'Arte" by Viola Alpi is a work that brings fashion and art together in a very special way. Imagine a kimono, a traditional garment, where the fabric becomes like a big painting. Alpi uses a very unique color, "Egyptian blue," along with other vibrant colors, to create a piece that seems to tell stories and makes us think of distant and fascinating cultures, like those of the Orient.

This is not just a piece of clothing: this kimono is a unique experience. Both the person wearing it and the one looking at it can feel like they are part of a fantasy world, where art and fashion speak to each other in a continuous and engaging dialogue.
