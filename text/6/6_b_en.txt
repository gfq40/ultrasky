In "Nucleo Blu," Franco Vitelli shows us how ancient art ideas can be used in a new and creative way. In this broken column, decorated with small pieces of marble, mirrors, colored glass, and Egyptian blue, there is an eight-sided shape at the center from which a Greek cross emergesâ€”a very old symbol of balance and perfection.

The artist left some parts of the work incomplete to invite the viewer to imagine and take part in creating the piece. In this way, the work becomes a playful mix of old and new, of stability and fragments, making us think about time, memories, and the delicate nature of things.
