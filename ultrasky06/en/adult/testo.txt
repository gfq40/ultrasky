"Fish" by Andrea Chidichimo blends surrealist elements with postmodern references, giving rise to a composition rich in suggestion and stylistic cross-contamination. The image, dominated by the vertical figure of a fish, symbolically evokes Christianity and, in a Gestalt-like reading, recalls the shape of pontifical headwear, expressing an upward movement ideally directed toward the heavens.

Set against a background of Egyptian Blue, the work incorporates scattered hieroglyphic signsâ€”hidden traces that refer to the concepts of "Ultra" and "Origin," suggesting a shared matrix and a layered depth of interpretation. Through this symbolic and chromatic poetics, the artist offers a visual and conceptual exploration that gradually reveals to the viewer a hidden wealth of meaning, going beyond the mere aesthetic experience and inviting them to explore the boundary between the visible and the invisible, between tangible reality and metaphysical dimension.
