Franco Vitelli’s work *“Per grazia ricevuta”* presents itself as an object of secular devotion—a profound reflection on gratitude, memory, and sacred symbolism. Crafted with extraordinary technical skill and compositional mastery, the piece merges ancient decorative elements with a contemporary language that invites contemplation. At the center of the composition, a blue heart—symbolizing purity and emotional depth—stands out against a gold background, a direct reference to votive icons and altarpieces. Surrounding it, an intricate circular pattern made of polychrome stones recalls the rose windows of cathedrals and Cosmatesque floors, creating a tension between the sacred and the ornamental, between faith and materiality. The cracks in the marble, the gold leaf details, and the geometric fragments draw the viewer into a space of visual meditation, where perfection is sought but never imposed. The work speaks with a silent yet intense voice—of faith in art, in humanity, and in that mysterious force that leads to transformation and to the act of giving. The title, *“Per grazia ricevuta”* (“For a Grace Received”), evokes the tradition of ex-votos, but reinterprets it in a personal and intimate way. Here, grace is not merely a spiritual gift: it is the rediscovery of an ancient art, the chance to revive a knowledge that seemed lost. In this sense, the work becomes a symbolic self-portrait, a gesture of gratitude toward tradition, beauty, and the very possibility of creation.
