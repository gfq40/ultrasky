Welcome to “Ultrasky: Discovering Egyptian Blue from Arts to Sciences.” You are at the beginning of a fascinating journey through time, matter, and light, uncovering one of the most mysterious and captivating pigments in human history: Egyptian Blue.

Born over 5,000 years ago at the hands of ancient Egyptian craftsmen, this color is not just beauty—it’s also science. As the first synthetic pigment in history, Egyptian Blue is a sustainable material with astonishing optical properties, capable of emitting infrared light. After disappearing during the Middle Ages, it re-emerged in Renaissance paintings—such as those by Raphael at Villa Farnesina—and today it takes center stage in cutting-edge scientific research, with applications ranging from energy to medicine.

In this exhibition, nine contemporary artists have reinterpreted the ancient pigment in a modern light, exploring its potential through diverse mediums: from sculpture to glass, from ceramics to digital art. Their works engage in a dialogue with matter, history, and light, creating a bridge between the past and the future.

Thanks to the collaboration with BLUENET, the largest international network of Egyptian Blue scholars, and the technological support of Adamantio srl, you will have the opportunity to observe the pigment like never before: through state-of-the-art infrared goggles, you can discover its invisible light and hidden energy.

Take the time to listen, observe, and let yourself be amazed. What is about to begin is a multisensory journey through science, art, and wonder.
