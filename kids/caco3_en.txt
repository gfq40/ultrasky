A Journey into the World of Moving Mosaics

In the “Ultrasky” exhibition, there is a truly special piece created by the CaCO3 group. They were inspired by an ancient Roman type of mosaic, famous for its tiny, colorful tiles, yet decided to transform it into something completely new.

Usually, mosaics stay still and do not move: they are like large pictures made up of small “tiles.” But CaCO3 came up with a revolutionary idea: they created a technique that conveys the impression of fluid tiles, as if reacting to the wind and constantly changing shape! Imagine countless small tiles dancing in the air, reflecting light and creating ever-changing plays of shadow.

Watching this work of art is like witnessing a ballet of colors: the light behaves like the wind, “shifting” the tiles so the mosaic appears alive. This is a new way of thinking about mosaics, which are usually fixed and flat. Here, everything moves, and the effect is both magical and surprising.

The CaCO3 group wanted to merge ancient tradition (the skill of old Roman craftsmen) with modern imagination, also using a special color called Egyptian blue. It’s a reminder of how wonderful it is to discover and experiment, even with techniques and materials that may seem old, yet can always be renewed with a bit of creativity!
