"Ideal Biology – Egyptian Blue Rose"
The third sculptural work explores the structural and symbolic potential of Egyptian blue, embodying it in the delicate, perfect, and ephemeral form of a rose. The hand-carved rose, shaped from a “block” of Egyptian blue, represents a journey through the dualities of the eternal and the fleeting. In this way, the piece invites reflection on the permanence of art and the transience of life.
Peducci creates an aesthetic tension that tells the story of a dream—an absolute yet ephemeral harmony.
