Stone Painting: a Mosaic Painted in Blue

Imagine stepping into a Roman house from the late Republic, arranged around a long visual axis that leads your eyes straight to the tablinum — the most prestigious room and the true scenic heart of the home.

Here, at the feet of the ancient visitor, unfolded an extraordinary work of art: the Nilotic mosaic of Privernum. A carpet of stone and color, where fantastic creatures, exotic animals, Eastern-style architecture, and river landscapes evoked the imagined Egypt of Roman culture. But the true surprise only came to light in recent times.

During archaeological and scientific investigations, something unique was discovered: the mosaic had been painted first. Beneath the tesserae, we can still see polychrome sinopias — actual preparatory drawings, painted with a brush and a full color palette. This is an exceptionally rare find in the ancient world.

Moreover, thanks to the use of VIL (Visible Induced Luminescence), a sophisticated diagnostic technique, a widespread presence of Egyptian blue was revealed among the tesserae themselves. The oldest synthetic pigment known to humankind has now re-emerged in the fine details of this mosaic masterpiece.

As Pliny the Elder once said, mosaics were “paintings made of stone” — and here, we see living proof. In this Nilotic threshold, the synergy between geometry, design, painting, and inlay reaches a peak of technical and symbolic refinement.
