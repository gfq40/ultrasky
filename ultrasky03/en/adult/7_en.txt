"Inganno" by Franco Vitelli is a work that challenges perception and reality through geometric intertwinings inspired by infinity symbols, enriched by the presence of Egyptian blue. The sculpture skillfully plays with the viewer's sight, revealing a second perceptual dimension: when observed through a special VIL viewer, the colors vanish, leaving only geometric lines. This visual metamorphosis underscores Vitelli's reflection on the deceptive nature of contemporary reality, suspended between what we see and what we believe we perceive, creating a poetic dimension in which doubt becomes essential to understanding the work.
