In the work Oscillazione by the CaCO3 group, matter becomes the vehicle for a visual and conceptual investigation that moves between the historical depth of the pigment and the luminous rarefaction of glass. At the center of the work lies the ancient Egyptian blue, rediscovered not only as a color but as a temporal and perceptual device. The need to understand its chromatic and material qualities gives rise to an embryonic form—like the seed of a possible evolution, a tension between what is still shapeless and what is about to emerge.

The artwork presents itself as a layered surface in which the material presence of the pigment meets the transparency of Murano glass, arranged in tesserae of two different types. This glass layer, seemingly uniform, nevertheless reveals glimpses of the underlying sinopia, made with Egyptian blue powder applied a fresco onto a bedding mortar. Thus, the act of viewing is mediated: the primary color is not presented directly to the eye but veiled, hidden—like a memory emerging through the filter of time.

The visual effect is that of a double overlapping stain, created through contrasting processes: one from variations in the glass material, the other from a pictorial glaze. The resulting image resists clear definition, oscillating between the painterly and the material, between the visible and the invisible.

It is especially meaningful that the painted form appears blurred and only comes into focus in the infrared spectrum—a powerful metaphor that evokes the practices of restoration and diagnostic imaging, but also the very concept of vision as an interpretive and selective act.
