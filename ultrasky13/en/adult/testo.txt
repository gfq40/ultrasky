With the "Blue Geometries Sweater," Viola Alpi offers a refined example of how art and design can merge harmoniously. The geometric shapes, created in Egyptian blue, emerge on the surface of the garment, producing hypnotic and sophisticated visual effects. The sweater transcends the idea of a mere piece of clothing, becoming a true wearable work of art that communicates identity, elegance, and aesthetic awareness to those who choose to incorporate it into their everyday lives.
