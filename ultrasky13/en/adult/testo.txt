The sculpture Cosmic Movement offers a reflection on the mysterious structure of time in relation to the Cosmos. Time is understood and interpreted by the artist as non-linear, aligning with the recent insights of quantum physics. The two works, Kosmos and Cosmic Movement, are closely connected through the same temporal structure. Space is conceived as limitless and without boundaries, blurring the lines between the artwork and the Cosmos itself. It is a time immanent to Man and everything that surrounds him.

In Cosmic Movement, sound also plays a fundamental role, generated by the movement of the great Harp, whose strings hold our Universe, immersed in a primordial and ancestral sound. The blue color of the sphere is chosen to represent the appearance of our planet within the cosmic "darkness." In Cosmic Movement, the sounds within the harmony of the Universe animate our dreamsâ€”a constant rhythm of oneiric time, a measure of Beauty.
