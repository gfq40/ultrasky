In the "Ultrasky Scarf," Viola Alpi explores the depth and magic of Egyptian blue, creating a fashion item that is both a textile sculpture and visual poetry. The soft fabric captures light and reflects infinite shades of blue, forming an otherworldly sky that gently envelops the wearer. This piece thus becomes an invitation to immerse oneself in a realm of elegance and introspection, celebrating the emotional and symbolic power of color.
