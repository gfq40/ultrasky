"Sound Capacity – Egyptian Blue Flute"
The first work in Matteo Peducci’s triptych appears as a flute, hand-carved from Egyptian blue paste. The artist poetically explores the sound of antiquity through the use of an innovative material. Peducci transforms the sculpture into a metaphorical object, capable of resonating within the exhibition space as a testament to an eternal dialogue between matter and its invisible expression. Egyptian blue, with its millennia-old history, adds symbolic depth—evoking ancient civilizations while simultaneously projecting toward new expressive possibilities.
