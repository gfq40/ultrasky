Divinities Between Earth and Sky

Welcome to the section dedicated to the Eastern cult in the ancient Roman city of Privernum.

In front of you, you can admire extraordinary artifacts that reveal a fascinating and little-known reality: the presence, in this Latin center, of deities originating directly from the pantheon of ancient Egypt.

Among the objects on display, a refined bronze statuette of the goddess Isis Panthea stands out, dating back to the first century AD. Isis, represented here in a universal and cosmic form, is a perfect example of Roman religious syncretism: she wears a basileion with a crescent moon on her head, holds a cornucopia and a rudder, and is adorned with wings and a quiver — attributes drawn from various Greek and Roman deities. A goddess who protects, guides, and governs destiny.

Next to her, we meet Bes, the small yet powerful god who protected households and expectant women. With his stocky figure and fierce yet comical face, Bes — though far from classical aesthetic ideals — was welcomed with reverence into many Roman private homes.

Finally, a fragment of a hieroglyphic inscription evokes the goddess Bastet, “lady of the city where the chest of mummification is kept.” A phrase that transports us to the heart of Egyptian funerary rituals, suggesting not only visual familiarity but also ritual understanding of the Nile world.

These objects tell an ancient story of cultural dialogue, and are not mere works of art, but tangible traces of a bridge between distant worlds — witnesses of a spirituality that crossed seas, cultures, and centuries, and still speaks to us today, under the same sky.
