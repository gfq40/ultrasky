"A Journey Through Time and Space â€“ Composition 3"
The third work presented by Giuliano Giuman is an intense chromatic and material explosion, where Egyptian blue and Sinai sand meet in a dramatic visual composition. The dialogue between ancient and modern reaches its highest expressive potential here, with Egyptian blue powerfully emerging from the glassy matter, evoking a spiritual and symbolic dimension. The piece thus becomes a visual and emotional narrative, inviting the viewer to reflect on the connection between past and present, between the visible world and an evocative, metaphysical dimension.
