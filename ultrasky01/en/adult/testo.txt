"Blue is Blue" by Erica Tamborini presents itself as a fascinating reflection on the dualism between presence and absence, matter and spirit. The ephemeral dust of Egyptian Blue, settled within a geometric container, simultaneously reveals itself as both the residue of a creative process and a prelude to a yet-to-be-unveiled plastic form. According to Kandinsky, blue is the “Splendor of the Soul,” while Rudolf Steiner interprets it as a bridge to spiritual depth. Tamborini renders this dual essence of the color tangible through a work that becomes both an icon and an emblem: a speaking form, an assertion of identity that, through the fragility of the pigment, reveals the artist’s tension toward that which is invisible and transcendent.
