In this work, the CaCO3 group continues its exploration of Egyptian blue as a living and revealing material, at the heart of a reflection that extends from the visible to the invisible, from light to memory. The piece presents itself as a silent surface—seemingly simple, yet in reality densely layered: a light grey, almost dusty, material ground hosts at its center a rounded, blurred blue form, as if suspended in a time that is no longer linear.

As is typical of their approach, the composition is built through a process of controlled stratification: beneath the surface lies a sinopia painted with Egyptian blue powder on fresh mortar, while the upper layer is made of transparent Murano glass, laid out in tesserae of two different types. The pigment does not dominate the surface, but is instead concealed and filtered, rendered uncertain—almost a visual echo that is more sensed than seen.

This technique invites the viewer to adopt a slow, contemplative gaze—capable of grasping the intensity of chromatic and luminous variations in their apparent simplicity. The central blue stain does not assert itself as a defined figure, but instead presents itself as a mobile, oscillating presence—between body and aura, between interior and exterior, between painting and matter. It is an archetypal form, evoking cells, seeds, planets, or simply pulses of life: a potential origin, not yet fully defined.

The blurring of the painted form, clearly legible only in the infrared spectrum, reinforces the sense of “absence-presence” that characterizes the group's entire research.
