Science
Egyptian Blue is an inorganic, silica-based material containing copper and calcium, both of which are abundant in nature and make it possible to produce this pigment from food processing waste and electronic waste. Its lamellar structure enables exfoliation and use in nanotechnology, while its antibacterial properties and ability to regenerate biological tissues form the basis of various medical applications.

However, its most distinctive feature is the emission of fluorescence invisible to the human eye, detectable only in the near-infrared range. These characteristics are at the core of many of its innovative applications: in particular, its luminescence has attracted interest in fields such as forensic science, mitigating the overheating of environments, and next-generation solar energy systems.

Egyptian Blue boasts numerous advantages, including biocompatibility, sustainability, remarkable durability, and resistance to harsh environmental and climatic conditions.
