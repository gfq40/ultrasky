The Arts
“The color blue evokes the sea and the sky, as well as everything that is most abstract in nature.”
— Yves Klein

The convergence of art, science, and history is entrusted to nine Italian artists of various ages and backgrounds, each working in different expressive techniques ranging from painting to design, from ceramics to digital art. Every one of them uses Egyptian Blue in a unique way, integrating it among the key materials that define their artistic vision.

Egyptian Blue is, in fact, currently absent from contemporary art. This project aspires to revive the world’s oldest artificial material, creating a synergy capable of narrating—through a modern lens—both the ancient and the new story of a truly timeless color.
