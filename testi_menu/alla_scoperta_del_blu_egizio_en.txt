Egyptian Blue between Art and Science

The Ultrasky exhibition provides a unique opportunity to showcase the versatility and beauty of Egyptian Blue, regarded as a privileged material both in artistic expression and in the latest frontiers of scientific research. In particular, it highlights the sustainability and distinctive properties of this ancient compound—from biocompatibility to luminescence, all the way to climate change resistance—which make it a source of inspiration for numerous beneficial applications, ranging from medicine to catalysis, from next-generation solar energy to energy storage.

Thanks to the collaboration between artists and researchers from various fields, the exhibition seeks to promote Egyptian Blue as a premier material for the future, perfectly in keeping with Paul Klee’s prophecy:

“Our future is in the hands of creative minds.”
