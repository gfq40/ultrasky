The History of Egyptian Blue

Considered the first artificial pigment developed by humankind, Egyptian Blue was used in art and for decorative purposes more than five thousand years ago. During the Bronze Age and Classical Antiquity, it spread throughout the Middle East and the Mediterranean basin, but the knowledge needed to produce it was lost during the Middle Ages.

Reemerging sporadically and mysteriously during the Renaissance, Egyptian Blue nonetheless remained unknown for centuries, until the late 19th century when its synthesis process was rediscovered through joint research in archaeology and chemistry. The findings made during Napoleonâ€™s campaign in Egypt and the excavations at Pompeii were studied by numerous scientists of the time, including Chaptal, Sir Humphry Davy, and Michael Faraday.

At the dawn of the new millennium, the unexpected discovery of its intense luminescence reignited interest in the unique properties of this remarkable material. Over the last fifteen years, Egyptian Blue has once again taken center stage in increasingly in-depth interdisciplinary research, not only in the fields of archaeology and art but also in the creation of cutting-edge, high-tech materials.
