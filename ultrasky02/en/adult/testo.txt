In the work "Nucleo Blu," Franco Vitelli reinterprets the medieval Cosmatesque tradition with originality. The fragmented column, adorned with pieces of marble, mirrors, glass paste, and Egyptian blue, features an octagonal heart from which a Greek cross emanatesâ€”an ancient symbol of balance and perfection. Vitelli transforms these elements into a modern reflection on time, memory, and contemporary fragility. The deliberate incompleteness of the work invites the viewer to mentally fill in the missing parts, creating an intimate dialogue between the ancient and the modern, between stability and fragmentation.
