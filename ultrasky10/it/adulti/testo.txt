The Painter's Palette

During the archaeological excavations at Privernum, a surprising and quiet corner came to light — a place full of meaning: the spot where a painter once prepared his colors. There, in a discreet and almost hidden space, the remains of his complete palette were discovered.

This is an extraordinary find, because it doesn’t just show us traces of paint on walls, but the pigments themselves: the powders, clumps of color, and materials ready to be mixed with binders and transformed into frescoes, decorations, and sacred figures.

Among the pigments found were some of the most common shades in the Roman world: red ochre, yellow ochre, green earth, and charcoal black. But next to these earthy and fiery tones, one color emerged that tells a different, brighter story: Egyptian blue.

This pigment — one of the oldest synthetic blues in history — was already in use three thousand years before Christ. The result of a perfect alchemy, Egyptian blue arrived in Privernum as the legacy of ancient knowledge.

In this part of the exhibition, you can imagine the painter’s hand carefully measuring each pigment, mixing it with skill and technique, ready to adorn the walls of ancient Roman buildings.
