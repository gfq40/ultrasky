Time is usually marked by a steady, relentless rhythm. In Cosmic Movement, Stefano Conticelli turns this idea upside down: here, it is the sphere—painted in a deep Egyptian blue—that remains still, while everything else moves around it.

The shape of the artwork recalls a metronome, but instead of ticking time away, it seems to suspend it, as if the entire universe were rotating around a single, motionless point. The tapered structure and delicate metal lines create a visual tension, a fragile balance between motion and stillness.

Egyptian blue—a symbolic color of depth and eternity—becomes the gravitational center of the composition, evoking an unchanging core within the endless flow of time.

With Cosmic Movement, Conticelli offers us an alternative vision of time and space—an optical and conceptual illusion that challenges our perception of reality.
